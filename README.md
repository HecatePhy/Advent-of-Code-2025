# My Solutions to Advent of Code 2025

In November, I received an email about [Advent of FPGA](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/), which led me to notice the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.
It's the first time I've participated.
I found some parts interesting, so I'd love to share my thoughts here.

## 📋 Prologue

Since I only dedicate a small amount of my free time each day for those coding problems, I don't strive for optimal time/space complexity.
Instead, I admire the idea of best *Kolmogorov complexity* 😆.
Therefore, my solutions follows the principles:
- As runtime is not critical, I primarily use Python for its simplicity.
- I don't reinvent the wheel. I directly use the wheels from existing libraries (including both Python and C++)
