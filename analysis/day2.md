## ⚡️ Run

```bash
python src/day2.py testcases/day2_example.txt
python src/day2.py testcases/day2_input.txt
```

🛠️ requirements: `NULL`

## 💡 Prompt

1️⃣ Transfer from num to string: test if a string is composed of repeated terms.

2️⃣ Only test the repeated terms whose lengths are factors of num bits (in case the input is extremely long).

## 📊 Analysis

time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$ where $n$ is the length of input digits
